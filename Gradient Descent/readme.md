# Gradient Descent : Linear Regression

<h3>Overview </h3>  
Implemented gradient descent to find the line of best fit that predicts the relationship between 2 variables of your choice from a kaggle dataset.The dataset represents distance cycled vs calories burned. We'll create the line of best fit (linear regression) via gradient descent to predict the mapping.

<h3>Dependencies</h3>

numpy
Python 2 and 3 both work for this. Use pip to install any dependencies.

<h3>Usage</h3>

Just run python3 demo.py to see the results:
